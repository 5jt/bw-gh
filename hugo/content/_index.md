I’m Anne Tupker, member of the Institute of Masters of Wine, winner of the Mme Bollinger and the Sainsbury Prizes, and occasional judge for the _International Wine Challenge_ and _Decanter World Wine Awards_.

After many happy years sharing my wine discoveries, I have closed my business.

Thank you to everyone who shared this journey with me.

Good luck – and happy tippling!
