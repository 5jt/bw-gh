it features stunning new discoveries from recent travels and tastings as well as exciting new vintages of many old favourites. For delicious, good-value wines, hand-picked by a Master of Wine, look no further.


I hold a number of tastings of wines from this list throughout the year, as well as presenting tutored tastings and food & wine matching dinners. I also help with restaurant wine lists, organise tailor-made visits to wine regions, and track down particular wines for clients’ cellars.
